It's been a long time since I have had to write SQL statements.

I Created a MySQL workbench model (eer file) that replicates the Tables you provided.

I then had this model synchronized against a test MySQL database so I could run queries
against it.

Included the question3.sql file which shows my attempts at solving the questions.

I currently don't have the bandwidth to work through them.
